This is an exercise in pair programming + rapid prototyping. Come up with ideas for a site or web app to be built using **JQuery**. Be prepared to spend time on Wednesday working with your partner + creating a collaborative project pitch presentation - including a wireframe, design plan and JQ functions you want to use. On Monday pairs will pitch their ideas, share code research + get feedback from the class. You will then have the rest of Monday and Wednesday to work with your partner + check in with Rebecca. You'll present + critique each project on Monday the 23rd.
