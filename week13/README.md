##### Final Project
Your final is to create a website using HTML, CSS + JavaScript. It must contain clean + heavily commented code, thoughtful + appealing design and a title. You can use any JS library.

You will create a concept + wireframe(s) for the different layout of your pages. You must create a webpage that acts as a project proposal slide deck - explains your site  + includes relevant details. Create a slide only deck for your + host it on your class site.

Slide project proposal presentations + user testing will be Monday November 30 - please post a link to your presentation [here](https://github.com/IDMNYU/webDev_C_Fall2020/wiki/***-Final-Projects). In breakout rooms you will present and user test your project with your classmates. Everyone must participate, giving + receiving feedback.

Your Final Must be a CONTEMPORARY Web Page. This means responsive and using semantic HTML 5. I am not setting a page # requirement, but will be looking for evidence that you put effort into making the most technically + aesthetically sophisticated project you can.


Original Content - no memes! 
This should be a portfolio piece you can refer to after you graduate to showcase both your design + technical abilities (image-making is also a skill).
